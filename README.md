# My dotfiles

These are my configuration files for

  * vim
  * zsh
  * i3
  * more ...

The basic idea is to link the files in this repository to the corresponding
configuration files (e.g. `~/.vimrc -> vimrc`).  To see which files get linked,
checkout `install.conf.yaml`.

## Getting started

### Requirements

The following commands are assumed to be available for a successful installation:

* `wget` to download `nvim`
* `pip3` to install dependencies needed for `nvim` and `vim`
* `fuse` to be able to run the `nvim` AppImage
* `vim` so that the vim plugins can be installed

If these commands are missing, then the install script will output an error,
but nevertheless the config files will be installed.

It is highly recommended to install `zsh` even though no error will be shown if
it is missing.

### Installation

Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LudwigSchallner/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

To install, enter:
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

The zsh theme installed by default is
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for which it is
recommended to install the [Meslo Nerd
Font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k).

### I just want part of it

If you are in a hurry, just have a look at look at `install.conf.yaml`, it is
almost self-explained.  If you have a bit more time, checkout
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which is the bootstrapping
library used here.  It is also shipped as a submodule so that the installation
of the these files can happen without having to install it manually.

## What's inside

### `zsh`

The `zsh` shell is defined as default shell by appending `exec zsh` at the
bottom of the `~/.bashrc` (see `install.conf.yaml`).

The zsh plugins are managed by [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen),
which is provided as a git submodule.  _Note that the plugins get installed
only the first time you start a `zsh` shell._

The theme used is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
already configured for my taste.  To reconfigure it, run `p10k configure` or
just remove the file `p10k.zsh`.  Note that for this theme to work well, the
Meslo Nerd Font is recommended, see above.

Checkout `zshrc` to see which plugins are activated, they are defined right
after `bundle` (any recommendation is welcome!).

## Vim

Vim plugins are manage by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
which is shipped as a submodule.  To install all the plugins, run
`:PlugInstall` inside vim, or
```bash
vim +PlugInstall
```
from a terminal.
